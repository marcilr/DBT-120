The D-Link PersonalAirTM DBT-120revC USB Bluetooth Adapter is a very compact, low-profile 
solution based on the Bluetooth 2.0 specification, making it compatible with other Bluetooth 
enabled devices. The DBT-120 was designed and engineered from the ground up to be compact 
and portable, making it the perfect solution for notebook computers, but also just as easy 
to use with a desktop computer.

cellular phone.

Compatible with USB 1.1 and 2.0, the DBT-120 supports Windows XP SP2/2000 and Mac 10.4.3.

=============================
VMware player, with win XP, displays the dbt-120 as "Cambridge Silicon Radio 
Bluetooth Adapter"  Right-clicking the bllutooth icon in the task bar and selecting
"Open Bluetooth Settings | Options" allows checking the "Turn discovery on" which 
allows bluetooth devices to find the computer.

Select bluetooh under applications on the Blackberry allows selection of
"SPANGOLITE" the win XP workstation.  The prompts for "Enter number passkey 
for SPANGOLITE"  Entered 1234.  Then win XP prompts to allow the device and 
for the same passkey.
